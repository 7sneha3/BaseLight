# BaseLight

An interactive light-and-shadow animation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses mouse movements (on desktop) and finger touch (on mobile) to simulate dynamic light sources casting shadows on colored balls.

## How It Works

- The `mousemove` event updates the CSS variables `--mx` and `--my` to track cursor position.
- The `touchmove` event does the same on mobile devices.
- CSS variables drive the transformations and gradients of each `.ball` and `.shadow` element to simulate realistic lighting effects.
